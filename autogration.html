<h1>automation and integration</h1>
<section>
	<p>
		Automation doesn't mean complication.
		<br><br>
		Compared to traditional wiring, a modern building control system can reduce cabling and offers the added benefit of being easily adaptable to future changes or upgrades.

		At Burmark, we believe the smartest technology is the kind you never notice.

	<h2 class="sub-title">Multi-zone Audio</h2>
	<p>
  		Our multi-zone audio installations are designed for flexibility allowing each room to enjoy its own soundtrack—whether it’s streaming services or your personal vinyl collection. 

  		<br/><br/>
  		Zones can operate independently or be grouped for perfectly synchronised whole-home audio. From compact, single-stereo speakers in smaller rooms to powerful systems capable of filling your home with party-level volume, we ensure the right speaker is chosen for every zone. The result is a seamless, immersive listening experience throughout.

<section id="{{ anchor.shading }}">
	<h2 class="sub-title">Shading</h2>
	<p>
  		Electrical blinds and curtains that adjust to time, temperature, and presence or simply from your wall switch. Automatically close your blinds to simulate presence while your away from home or just when the sun goes down. 

  		<br/><br/>
  		External louvers or shades can be automatically stowed if the wind reaches pre-defined values.
  		
  		<br/><br/>
  		Burmark advocates for wired shading solutions—because in a world full of devices to charge, your shades shouldn’t be one of them.

	<h2 class="sub-title">Climate - HVAC</h2>
	<p>
  		Climate control with zoned heating and/or cooling.
