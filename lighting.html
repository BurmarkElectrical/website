	<h2 class="sub-title">Technical Lighting and Control Design</h2>
	<p>
		 Working together we plan and implement lighting systems that enhance both functionality and atmosphere in your space. Considered light placement, detailed luminaire selection and robust control are the basis of all our systems.
		 <br><br>
		 Control your home the way that suits you—whether through your smart device, elegant wall switches, or fully automated scenes. Using industry standards like <a class="glossary" href="{{ navigation.autogration }}#{{ anchor.knx }}">KNX</a> and DALI, we deliver smart lighting systems that perform reliably over time.

	<h2 class="sub-title">Human-centric Lighting</h2>
	<p>
		 Human-centric lighting (HCL) supports our natural body clock by mimicking the changing light of the day. Studies show it can improve sleep, mood, and focus by aligning with our circadian rhythms—boosting wellbeing.

		 <br><br>
		 Using tuneable white lights allows dynamic adjustment of the colour temperature throughout the day to match natural light cycles — fully automated. 

		 <br><br>
		 In the morning and evening, the light is warmer (more yellow) and softer to promote relaxation, while during the day it becomes brighter and cooler to support focus and alertness.

<section id="{{ anchor.pre-built-panels }}">
	<h2 class="sub-title">Pre-build Smart Panels</h2>
	<p>
		 Smart and automated lighting control doesn’t have to be expensive. To reduce onsite commissioning and troubleshooting, we pre-build and test our lighting panels in house before getting onsite.

		 <br><br>
		 Once the lighting design has been finalised with you, we handle the complete backend process—designing, building, and thoroughly testing a plug-and-play* control panel that can be installed on-site by your electrical contractor or our in-house electricians.
